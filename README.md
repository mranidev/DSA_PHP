## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for writing efficient and optimized PHP code. This repository serves as a reference and learning resource for various data structures and algorithms commonly used in programming.

## Data Structures

In this section, you'll find implementations and explanations of various data structures, including but not limited to:

- [Arrays](https://github.com/mranidev/DSA_PHP/blob/main/ARRAYS.md)
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

Each data structure includes code examples, explanations, and complexity analysis.

## Algorithms

This section covers a wide range of algorithms, including:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- and more!

Each algorithm comes with detailed explanations, code implementations, and time/space complexity analysis.
