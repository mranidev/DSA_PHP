## Creating Arrays

To create an array in PHP, you can use square brackets `[]` or the `array()` constructor. Here's how:

```php
$myArray = []; // Empty array
$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Array with values
```

## Adding Elements - Add to End

You can add an element to the end of an array using the [] operator:
```php
$numbers[] = 6; // Adds 6 to the end of the $numbers array
```
